The 360 Modena was the first Ferrari to feature an all-aluminum space-frame chassis, which was 40% stiffer and 28% lighter than the steel chassis of the F355. This innovative construction allowed the 360 to offer improved handling and acceleration, with a 0 to 100 km/h time of just 4.5 seconds and a top speed of over 295 km/h. The 360 Modena was powered by a 3.6-liter V8 engine that produced 400 horsepower, giving it a thrilling performance edge. The car’s design, created by Pininfarina, was more rounded and modern compared to previous Ferraris, with a focus on aerodynamics that included a flat underbody and a rear diffuser. The 360 Modena was also one of the first Ferraris to feature an optional F1-style paddle-shift gearbox, offering quicker gear changes and a more engaging driving experience. Inside, the car offered a more spacious and comfortable cabin, with advanced features like climate control and a premium sound system. The Ferrari 360 Modena was a critical success, praised for its balance of performance, handling, and everyday usability, and it laid the groundwork for Ferrari’s future mid-engined sports cars.",
